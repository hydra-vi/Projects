# Online Shopping Intention Analysis with Python

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing online shopping intentions using Python. It utilizes data processing, visualization, and clustering techniques to gain insights into user behavior on e-commerce websites. The primary goal is to identify and understand customer segments based on their interactions with the website and whether these interactions lead to revenue generation.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the "online_shoppers_intention.csv" file. It provides information on various aspects of user interactions on the website, such as page duration, bounce rates, and whether the visit resulted in revenue generation.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `pandas` for data processing
- `matplotlib` for creating data visualizations
- `seaborn` for enhancing data visualizations
- `plotly` for interactive plotting
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning, including the K-Means clustering algorithm
- `scikit-plot` for visualization of clustering results


## Analysis

The project comprises the following major steps:

### Data Preprocessing

In this step, we address the preparation of the dataset for analysis. We handle missing data and select the most relevant features. Data preprocessing is a crucial phase to ensure the quality and reliability of the data used for subsequent steps.

### Clustering

We leverage the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct segments. Clustering helps identify patterns and similarities among customers based on their interactions with the website. This step plays a pivotal role in understanding user behavior and preferences.

### Visualization

To gain a deeper understanding of the clustering results, we employ visualization techniques. We explore the relationships between page duration and bounce rates for different clusters. Visualizations help us interpret the data more effectively and extract meaningful insights.

## Results

The project's results are evaluated using the following metrics and visualizations:

### Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)

The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) is a measure used to assess the similarity between the clustering results and the actual revenue generation. A high ARI score indicates that the clusters align well with the revenue-generating groups, while a low score may signify a lack of alignment.

### Confusion Matrices

Confusion matrices are employed to visualize the performance of the clustering model. They provide a comprehensive view of the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. These matrices are invaluable for assessing the quality of the clustering model's predictions.

These metrics and visualizations offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of the clustering analysis in identifying and understanding customer segments based on their online shopping interactions.
